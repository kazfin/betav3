<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">Please note that the following fixes are for the vanilla, modless version of Bad Life Simulator only. In some cases, certain mods can introduce new bugs that may not be accounted for here.</p>
<br>
<h3>Is this game open source?</h3>
<p style="width: 60%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">Yes, Bad Life Simulator is completely open source, so long as you follow the license (MIT License for the code and all SVG files, CC-BY-4.0 for the PNGs and XCFs). Please note that certain mods may not be open source or free to redistribute.</p>
<br>
<h3>I would like a copy of this game to run locally or mod. How do I get one?</h3>
<p style="width: 60%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">Go to the <a href="https://github.com/badlifesimulator/" target="blank">Github page</a>, click on the repo with the highest version number (the most recent update), then click the "code" dropdown box, and click on "download zip".<br><br>To play the game locally, extract the zip and open the "index" file. If it asks what app to open it with, just click on your browser and click/check "always".</p>
<br>
<h3>Why am I seeing "Get a browser that was made past the year 1997"?</h3>
<p style="width: 60%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">If you're seeing this error, it means JavaScript is not enabled on your browser. BLS requires JavaScript to function. To fix this, go into your browser's settings, search "javascript", click enable, and then refresh the page.<br><br>If it's already enabled, refresh the page. If this still doesn't work, BLS may be blacklisted from using javascript. To fix this, click the button to the left of the website's URL, then click "site settings". Then, scroll down to JavaScript, click the dropdown box, and then click "allow".<br><br>If JavaScript still doesn't work, or you can't find these options, your browser may not support JavaScript at all. In this case, please try a different browser.</p>
<br>
<h3>Why has all my save data dissapeared?</h3>
<p style="width: 60%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">Your save data can be deleted if you delete your browser's cache. Unfortunately, there is no way to recover this lost data unless you have a .bls file save that you can <a href="./save.html">load</a> from. If you recently switched browsers, you can try and transfer the data between your old browser and new browser.</p>
<br>
<h3>Why am I getting stuck on the "You will be redirected automatically" screen?</h3>
<p style="width: 60%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">If you're playing on the website, check your internet connection. If you're sure you're connected, try to run a speed test. If you're playing offline, this is a bug. Please report it in the #bug-reports channel of our <a href="https://discord.gg/DPGZ26BKTA" target="_blank">discord server</a> with details including what you did to get stuck, what you were trying to do, as well as any other details you deem important. If you've used the console to change any variables, this is a horror of your own creation. If you're playing on a mod, try to contact its creator(s) about the issue.</p>
<br>
<h3>Why is the screen scaled weirdly? The buttons and text are really small/large and some buttons may overlap.</h3>
<p style="width: 60%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">This is a common problem that could be caused by incorrect screen scaling. To Fix this, zoom in or out in <a href="./settings.html">settings</a> until the UI looks correct.</p>
<br>
<h3>Why does the game not work properly all of a sudden? Buttons and actions don't work as expected etc.</h3>
<p style="width: 60%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">There may have been an update that clashes with your current save somehow. Please start a new life in order to fix this problem. If that doesn't work, you might have to <b>wipe your save entirely</b> <a href="./save.html">here</a>.</p>
