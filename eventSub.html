<!--eventSub pages are for events that run before events. For example, if I just graduated high school, but also my entire family died, I would want to know both of them. One would be an eventSub and the other would be an event. It's just an easier way of running multiple events. Looking at the js for both this page and also the regular events page should clear things up a bit more if I didn't explain it well (which I didn't).-->
